                    <h1>Virtual Reality</h1>
                    <p>Virtual reality(VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training) and business (such as virtual meetings). Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR.</p>
                    <p>Currently, standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates auditory and video feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through haptic technology.</p>

                    <h1>Augmented Reality</h1>
                    <p>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.   AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.  The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment).  This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment.  In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one.   Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality.</p>
                    <p>The primary value of augmented reality is the manner in which components of the digital world blend into a person's perception of the real world, not as a simple display of data, but through the integration of immersive sensations, which are perceived as natural parts of an environment. The earliest functional AR systems that provided immersive mixed reality experiences for users were invented in the early 1990s, starting with the Virtual Fixtures system developed at the U.S. Air Force's Armstrong Laboratory in 1992.    Commercial augmented reality experiences were first introduced in entertainment and gaming businesses.  Subsequently, augmented reality applications have spanned commercial industries such as education, communications, medicine, and entertainment. In education, content may be accessed by scanning or viewing an image with a mobile device or by using markerless AR techniques.</p>
                    <p>Augmented reality is used to enhance natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences. With the help of advanced AR technologies (e.g. adding computer vision, incorporating AR cameras into smartphone applications and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulated. Information about the environment and its objects is overlaid on the real world. This information can be virtual. Augmented Reality is any experience which is artificial and which adds to the already existing reality or real, e.g. seeing other real sensed or measured information such as electromagnetic radio waves overlaid in exact alignment with where they actually are in space. Augmented reality also has a lot of potential in the gathering and sharing of tacit knowledge. Augmentation techniques are typically performed in real time and in semantic contexts with environmental elements. Immersive perceptual information is sometimes combined with supplemental information like scores over a live video feed of a sporting event. This combines the benefits of both augmented reality technology and heads up display technology (HUD).</p>

                    <h2>C#</h2>
                    <p>C# would be a useful VR programming language for both veteran and new developers who are just getting started. It is good to know because it is widely used for developing games with Unity, the most popular game engine out there. It will work on both Mac and PC, and a ton of VR apps are created with C#. All in all, it just makes sense to know the most popular programming language that is used with the most popular gaming engine. Should you require some additional development help, it has a wide network of designers as well. Also, since Unity implements a lot of the components of C#, it makes it a popular choice for programming AR apps as well.</p>

                    <h2>C++</h2>
                    <p>If you are looking to build something more advanced, for example, a product with Unreal Engine C++ would top the list of best virtual reality programming languages. For this reason, it is best to make the determination of the scope of your project first because this will dictate which platform you will need. If it is relatively small, you can use C#, but for large scale works, you will need C++. The same is true if you are creating an AR app. C++ is the right choice for creating sizeable AR apps because it allows a large part of the app to be implemented and developed via its syntax.</p>

                    <h2>Java</h2>
                    <p>Due to its robust nature, Java has become a popular AR programming language. It is an object-oriented language, and its features make it a good choice for creating components of the AR app. If you are creating a high-end product, Java is definitely the one to go with. It also comes packed with a 3D API, which will allow you to build and implement all kinds of components with relative ease. This API makes Java very useful for VR development because it enables you to generate the needed 3D images and track body movements.</p>

                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is known for its versatility. In fact, it ranks as a top augmented reality programming language because it has been worked on over the course of its history to be very comprehensive, thus providing developers with a very useful development environment good for building AR apps. If you are looking for even more reasons to work with JavaScript, consider its vast number of libraries and frameworks. It is beneficial for developing headgear and is being used by top companies such as HTC Vibe and Oculus Rift to create cutting edge products.</p>

                    <h2>Python</h2>
                    <p>While Python may not be the first to come to mind when talking about coding in virtual reality, it offers a lot of benefits, especially for developers who do not have a lot of experience. One of the main reasons for this is because it is straightforward and easy to understand, and it is possible to create something without writing too much code. If you are looking for even more motivation, it will be easy to transition to something more advanced such as C#, when you have a solid foundation of Python.</p>

                    <h2>Swift</h2>
                    <p>Swift is the official language for Apple devices. While it may not enjoy the mega popularity of some of the other devices on the list, it will be easy to get started creating AR apps if you already have some experience. Not only does Apple have an official programming language, but they have their very own SDK as well called the ARKit. Therefore, if you know Swift, it will be easy for you to start creating AR apps for iOS devices.</p>
