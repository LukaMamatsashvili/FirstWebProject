                <h1>Game Development</h1>
                <div id="p">
                    <p>Video game development is the process of developing a video game. The effort is undertaken by a developer, ranging from a single person to an international team dispersed across the globe. Development of traditional commercial PC and console games is normally funded by a publisher, and can take several years to reach completion. Indie games usually take less time and money and can be produced by individuals and smaller developers. The independent game industry has been on the rise, facilitated by the growth of accessible game development software such as Unity platform and Unreal Engine and new online distribution systems such as Steam and Uplay, as well as the mobile game market for Android and iOS devices.</p>
                    <p>Mainstream commercial PC and console games are generally developed in phases: first, in pre-production, pitches, prototypes, and game design documents are written; if the idea is approved and the developer receives funding, then full-scale development begins. The development of a complete game usually involves a team of 20-100 individuals with various responsibilities, including designers, artists, programmers, and testers. Here are some of the most preferred programming languages that game developers must be aware of.</p>

                    <h2>C++</h2>
                    <p>Despite its high entry barrier, C++ is one of the most popular and commonly used programming languages for game designers. It offers a high abstraction level for both fine object-oriented programming and generic programming, providing direct control over hardware and graphical processes. Additionally, C++ allows the optimisation of special parts to a very high level - a feature almost impossible to achieve with other languages. C++ is used to build most big console and Windows games. Apart from that, popular games built using C++ include Assassin's Creed series, Counter-Strike, Football Pro, Starcraft, Master of Orion III. </p>

                    <h2>C#</h2>
                    <p>Despite considered easier than C++, C# is a powerful language. Its XNA framework makes it perfect for building games on Windows and Xbox. Additionally, C#'s game engine Unity3D and Xamarin enables developers to build games on all platforms including iOS, Android, PlayStation and Windows. C# is as popular in the gaming industry due to its efficiency and scalability. Popular games developed using C# include Assassin's Creed series, Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run. </p>

                        <h2>Java</h2>
                        <p>Given Java's versatility and rich collection of open-source material, it is popularly used for the development of indie and mobile games. It is easy-to-use, is beginner friendly and can write a range of reusable system-agnostic code. When compared with C++, Java offers easy writing, debugging, learning and compiling. Games including the likes of Mission Impossible III, Minecraft, FIFA 11, and Ferrari GT 3: WOrld Track, have all been created using Java. </p>

                        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                        <p>JavaScript is one of the best programming languages for interactive online games. It integrates with web technologies including CSS and php, allowing the development of cross-platform mobile games.
                            JavaScript is often used along with php5 since the latter cannot create animation or interactivity. Additionally, contributing to its popularity is JavaScript's humongous online community and large number of frameworks. Some popular games made with JavaScript include Hangman, HexGI, Little Alchemy, Swoop and Polycraft. </p>

                    <h2>Python</h2>
                    <p>Although not as popular as Java or C++, Python is used for game development. Its PyGame library is developer-friendly, easy to use for building games and enables developers to prototype games quickly. Additionally, just like Java and C++, Python also runs on OOP principles. Its simple learning curve makes Python a go-to option for many game developers. Some popular games built using Python include Battlefield 2, Disney's Toontown Online, Eve Online and Frets on Fire. </p>
