                <h1>Web Development</h1>
                <div id="p">
                    <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management. Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites). The basic tools involved are programming languages called php (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others. There are three main types of web development: front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development.</p>
                    <p>Front-end development involves the “client-facing” side of web development. That is to say that it generally refers to the portion of the site, app, or digital product that users will see and interact with. A Front-End Developer, therefore, is responsible for the way a digital product looks and “feels,” which is why they are often also referred to as Web Designers. Front-End Developers will usually need to possess a solid understanding of programming languages, including php, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, Bootstrap, Backbone, AngularJS, and EmberJS.</p>
                    <p>If Front-End Developers are responsible for how a digital product looks, Back-End Developers are focused on how it works. This means they’re responsible for overseeing what's under the hood, including database interactions, user authentication, server, network and hosting configuration, and business logic.
                        The primary responsibility of Back-End Developers is to ensure the functionality of the site, including its responsiveness and speed. To do that, Back-End Developers have to know how to build servers with modern frameworks (while developing custom APIs and serving static websites and files), and how to manage databases and data on a web server. Typically, they use server-side languages, including PHP, Ruby, and Python, as well as tools including MySQL, Oracle, and Git.</p>
                    <p>A Full-Stack Developer is someone familiar with both front- and back-end development. They are generalists, adept at wearing both hats, and familiar with every layer of development. Obviously, employers want to hire Full-Stack Developers - according to an Indeed study, they are the fourth-most in-demand job in tech.</p>

                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>There is no doubt that JavaScript is the King of web development and probably the most popular language among web developers. It’s also the only language that allows you to create web applications, both frontend, and backend as well as mobile applications (React Native).
                        The strength of Javascript is not just it can run on browser and server using Nodejs but also the awesome frameworks and libraries it has for web development and app development.
                        For example, you can use React.js and Angular for frontend, Nodejs for backend, and React Native for creating cross-platform (both Android and iOS) mobile apps.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Python</h2>
                    <p>Python is another language which has gained a lot of popularity in recent year. While it's not exactly new and has passed the test of time, it's probably the most versatile programming language at the moment.
                        You can use Python for web development, Data Science, Scripting, and Automation. Similar to JavaScript, Python also enjoys huge community support and has a lot of useful frameworks, libraries, and tools that can help you create a web application in quick time.
                        For example, you can use Django to create full-stack web applications. If you want more control, you can also use Flask, a minimalist web development framework.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>TypeScript</h2>
                    <p>TypeScript is a modern programming language for web development. Just like we have C and C++, TypeScript can be considered as JavaScript++ though it's not as popular as C++.
                        The good part of TypeScript is that it adds type-safety in JavaScript code which means you can catch nasty JavaScript type-related errors in the development phase.
                        It also makes developing object-oriented code easy for JavaScript and several inbuilt debugging tools of TypeScript make web development really easy.</p>

                    <h2>PHP</h2>
                    <p>PHP is one of the best programming languages when it comes to creating web applications.
                        It's a dynamic, server-side scripting language that makes it really easy to create fully functional web applications. If that’s not enough, half of the internet is running on PHP's shoulder, remember WordPress, the most popular web application software is made on PHP.
                        PHP also has frameworks like Laraval, which is both powerful and allows you to swiftly create web applications using a model–view–controller architectural pattern.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Ruby</h2>
                    <p>Ruby is another programming language that is really great for web development. Similar to PHP and Python, Ruby is also easy to learn and goo for beginners.
                        What makes Ruby special for web development is the Ruby on Rails framework which powers websites like Github, Shopify, Airbnb, Groupon, GoodReads, and Kickstarter.
                        If you don't know, Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer and php, CSS, and JavaScript for user interfacing.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>php & CSS</h2>
                    <p>While php and CSS is not really a programming language, but they are the backbone for web development and every web developer must learn them.
                        php provides the structure while CSS provides the style and helps them to look better and more visually appealing. If you want to become a serious frontend developer then you must master these two.
                        The good thing about them is that you can easily master them in a few weeks and they are relatively easier to learn as well.</p>
