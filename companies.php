                    <img src="images/carfax-squarelogo-1563547087271.png">
                    <p>The software management really supports their employees and pushes for a good work-life balance. Pair programming isn't for everyone, so consider that. Teams hire based on personal fit just as much as technical skills given the collaborative environment.</p>

                    <h2>Google</h2>

                    <img src="images/google-squarelogo-1441130773284.png">
                    <p>Google is great for well-established people with international reputations and double-digit counts of important papers. It's also a relatively solid place for a new graduate, because you'll have smart colleagues and because Google does its chosen brand of engineering very well.</p>

                    <img src="images/microsoft-squarelogo-1479856042252.png">

                    <p>MathWorks is a great place to work, if you like this type of environment. It has great core values and is truly a rational workplace. The environment is very collaborative.</p>

                    <img src="images/meta-squareLogo-1636117276319.png">
                    <p>Working at Meta is good for the resume, but you don't have to forget that it is very huge company, so it is very hard to present your self, no even progression. It can be hard some days at Meta but it is easy to forget that you are literally making the most advanced technology in the world with this amazing company.</p>

                    <img src="images/cisco-systems-squarelogo-1479855777953.png">
                    <p>Cisco is a nice place to work. Balancing of family life and work is easy. More opportunities for exploring various technologies and domains. Compensation for job and designation is very good.</p>

                    <img src="images/dell-squarelogo-1558122709342.png">
                    <p>Dell Technologies is a great place to work overall. Only complaint is pay isn't as competitive as some other tech companies. Work life balance and culture is great. Dell has many very smart people.</p>

                    <img src="images/ibm-squareLogo-1626088539071.png">
                    <p>This is a great place to work. It is a big company so it is easy to move between departments and learn new things. Only down side is that since it is big company it is bit slower to move up the ladder.</p>
